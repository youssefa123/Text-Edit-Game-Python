# Text-Edit-Game-Python
This code is a text-based game where the player is tasked with retrieving a key to access an underground city called Utopia. The game begins by asking the player if they would like to retrieve the key, and if they answer "Yes" or "Y", they are presented with two options for approaching the task: "Stealthy" or "Loud". If the player chooses "Stealthy", they are given a series of options to distract guards and retrieve the key. If they choose "Loud", they are given different options to distract guards and retrieve the key. Depending on the player's choices and actions, the game will have different outcomes and endings. The game also offers the option to play again at the end of each playthrough.
